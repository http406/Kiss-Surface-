### **What is the Kiss Surface?**  
The **Kiss Surface** is a 3D mathematical surface characterized by its **hourglass-like shape**, smoothly transitioning from a **wide base** to a **narrow waist** and then expanding again. The name "Kiss Surface" comes from its resemblance to a pair of touching (or "kissing") surfaces.

It is commonly used in **mathematical visualization** and **differential geometry** to illustrate interesting curvature properties.
